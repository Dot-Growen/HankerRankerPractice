// create a variable "count" to count the number of tallest candles 
// create a loop the iterate through the arr
// set a condition increments the count for each tallest



function birthdayCakeCandles(arr) {

    let tallest = Math.max(...arr)
    let count = 0

    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == tallest) {
            count++
        }
    }
    return count;
